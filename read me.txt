The goal of this application is to calculate how many steps a knight has to take from one cell to another. Theuser can create, or log in to an account stored on a MySQL database. Then, the user gives input for the startingand destination cell on the chessboard. The algorithm uses breadth first search to find the number of requiredsteps. At the same time, it stores the searching history of each user on the MySQL database, so the user canlook it up later or while the game is in process.
